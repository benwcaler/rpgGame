# LORD OF THE RINGS

### About
This project is used as a display of my JQuery know-how. It is a very simple game that pits two players against eachother in a battle to the death. I used a fair amount of JQuery and a lot of css transitions to accomplish the flow and logic of the game. 

### My thoughts on the project

Truth be told ---- I'm not terribly happy with it. I would have benefitted from more pseudocoding at the beginning. Much of the logic was thrown together a long the way and that led to the necessity of too many flags and variables. I was hell-bent on using css transitions which caused me to keep many of the elements separate instead of condensing using 'this'. Given more thought and time (and pseudocoding), I could have probably come up with a better solution. Something else that would have been helpful would have been using css-grid. Grid would have lent itself to a more robust usage of 'this' as I moved the elements around the screen. However, using grid would have keept me from using the transitions due to grid transitions not being available yet (as far as I know). 

Nevertheless, the project is complete and working. /thumbsup
